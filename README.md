# Demo StarterKit for Twig

The Demo StarterKit for Twig is meant to be used as a demo that highlights how to combine Twig and Pattern Lab. It is currently very thin. We're looking for maintainers who may be interested in making this demo the equal to if not better than the Mustache demo.

## Requirements

The Demo StarterKit for Twig requires the following PatternEngine:

* `pattern-lab/patternengine-twig`: [documentation](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-php-twig#twig-patternengine-for-pattern-lab), [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-php-twig), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pattern-lab/patternengine-twig)

## Install

This StarterKit can be installed using the following command:

    php core/console --starterkit --install pattern-lab/starterkit-twig-demo

It is recommended that you **do not** install this StarterKit as a dependency for your Pattern Lab project via Composer.

## Edit Files

After installation the files for this StarterKit can be found in `source/`.
